# LoL_Meta_Team_Composition_Winrate_Advantage_by_Rank
This is a personal project that uses the Riot Games API and Python to analyze how much of an advantage does the team with the higher win rate champions have over a team with "less meta" champions. The data was collected during LoL Patch 25.22 and is presented with a graph made in Tableau.
